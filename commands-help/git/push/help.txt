                  [--no-verify] [<repository> [<refspec>...]]

DESCRIPTION
       Updates one or more branches, tags, or other references in a remote repository from your local repository, and
       sends all necessary data that isn’t already on the remote.

       The simplest way to push is git push <remote> <branch>. git push origin main will push the local main branch
       to the main branch on the remote named origin.

       The <repository> argument defaults to the upstream for the current branch, or origin if there’s no configured
       upstream.

       To decide which branches, tags, or other refs to push, Git uses (in order of precedence):

        1. The <refspec> argument(s) (for example main in git push origin main) or the --all, --mirror, or --tags
           options

        2. The remote.*.push configuration for the repository being pushed to

        3. The push.default configuration. The default is push.default=simple, which will push to a branch with the
           same name as the current branch. See the CONFIGURATION section below for more on push.default.

       git push may fail if you haven’t set an upstream for the current branch, depending on what push.default is set
       to. See the UPSTREAM BRANCHES section below for more on how to set and use upstreams.

       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you push into it, by setting up hooks there.
       See documentation for git-receive-pack(1).

OPTIONS
       <repository>
           The "remote" repository that is the destination of a push operation. This parameter can be either a URL
           (see the section GIT URLS below) or the name of a remote (see the section REMOTES below).

       <refspec>...
           Specify what destination ref to update with what source object.

           The format for a refspec is [+]<src>[:<dst>], for example main, main:other, or HEAD^:refs/heads/main.

           The <src> is often the name of the local branch to push, but it can be any arbitrary "SHA-1 expression"
           (see gitrevisions(7)).

           The <dst> determines what ref to update on the remote side. It must be the name of a branch, tag, or other
           ref, not an arbitrary expression.

           The + is optional and does the same thing as --force.

           You can write a refspec using the fully expanded form (for example refs/heads/main:refs/heads/main) which
           specifies the exact source and destination, or with a shorter form (for example main or main:other). Here
           are the rules for how refspecs are expanded, as well as various other special refspec forms:

           •   <src> without a :<dst> means to update the same ref as the <src>, unless the remote.<repository>.push
               configuration specifies a different <dst>. For example, if main is a branch, then the refspec main
               expands to main:refs/heads/main.

           •   If <dst> unambiguously refers to a ref on the <repository> remote, then expand it to that ref. For
               example, if v1.0 is a tag on the remote, then HEAD:v1.0 expands to HEAD:refs/tags/v1.0.

           •   If <src> resolves to a ref starting with refs/heads/ or refs/tags/, then prepend that to <dst>. For
               example, if main is a branch, then main:other expands to main:refs/heads/other

           •   The special refspec : (or +: to allow non-fast-forward updates) directs Git to push "matching"
               branches: for every branch that exists on the local side, the remote side is updated if a branch of
               the same name already exists on the remote side.

           •   <src> may contain a * to indicate a simple pattern match. This works like a glob that matches any ref
               matching the pattern. There must be only one * in both the <src> and <dst>. It will map refs to the
               destination by replacing the * with the contents matched from the source. For example,
               refs/heads/*:refs/heads/* will push all branches.

           •   A refspec starting with ^ is a negative refspec. This specifies refs to exclude. A ref will be
               considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does not match any negative
               refspec. Negative refspecs can be pattern refspecs. They must only contain a <src>. Fully spelled out
               hex object names are also not supported. For example, git push origin 'refs/heads/*'
               '^refs/heads/dev-*' will push all branches except for those starting with dev-

           •   If <src> is empty, it deletes the <dst> ref from the remote repository. For example, git push origin
               :dev will delete the dev branch.

           •   tag <tag> expands to refs/tags/<tag>:refs/tags/<tag>. This is technically a special syntax for git
               push and not a refspec, since in git push origin tag v1.0 the arguments tag and v1.0 are separate.

           •   If the refspec can’t be expanded unambiguously, error out with an error indicating what was tried, and
               depending on the advice.pushUnqualifiedRefname configuration (see git-config(1)) suggest what refs/
               namespace you may have wanted to push to.

       Not all updates are allowed: see PUSH RULES below for the details.

       --all, --branches
           Push all branches (i.e. refs under refs/heads/); cannot be used with other <refspec>.

       --prune
           Remove remote branches that don’t have a local counterpart. For example a remote branch tmp will be
           removed if a local branch with the same name doesn’t exist any more. This also respects refspecs, e.g.
           git push --prune remote refs/heads/*:refs/tmp/* would make sure that remote refs/tmp/foo will be removed
           if refs/heads/foo doesn’t exist.

       --mirror
           Instead of naming each ref to push, specifies that all refs under refs/ (which includes but is not limited
           to refs/heads/, refs/remotes/, and refs/tags/) be mirrored to the remote repository. Newly created local
           refs will be pushed to the remote end, locally updated refs will be force updated on the remote end, and
           deleted refs will be removed from the remote end. This is the default if the configuration option
           remote.<remote>.mirror is set.

       -n, --dry-run
           Do everything except actually send the updates.

       --porcelain
           Produce machine-readable output. The output status line for each ref will be tab-separated and sent to
           stdout instead of stderr. The full symbolic names of the refs will be given.

       -d, --delete
           All listed refs are deleted from the remote repository. This is the same as prefixing all refs with a
           colon.

       --tags
           All refs under refs/tags are pushed, in addition to refspecs explicitly listed on the command line.

       --follow-tags
           Push all the refs that would be pushed without this option, and also push annotated tags in refs/tags that
           are missing from the remote but are pointing at commit-ish that are reachable from the refs being pushed.
           This can also be specified with configuration variable push.followTags. For more information, see
           push.followTags in git-config(1).

       --signed, --no-signed, --signed=(true|false|if-asked)
           GPG-sign the push request to update refs on the receiving side, to allow it to be checked by the hooks
           and/or be logged. If false or --no-signed, no signing will be attempted. If true or --signed, the push
           will fail if the server does not support signed pushes. If set to if-asked, sign if and only if the server
           supports signed pushes. The push will also fail if the actual call to gpg --sign fails. See git-receive-
           pack(1) for the details on the receiving end.

       --atomic, --no-atomic
           Use an atomic transaction on the remote side if available. Either all refs are updated, or on error, no
           refs are updated. If the server does not support atomic pushes the push will fail.

       -o <option>, --push-option=<option>
           Transmit the given string to the server, which passes them to the pre-receive as well as the post-receive
           hook. The given string must not contain a NUL or LF character. When multiple --push-option=<option> are
           given, they are all sent to the other side in the order listed on the command line. When no
           --push-option=<option> is given from the command line, the values of configuration variable
           push.pushOption are used instead.

       --receive-pack=<git-receive-pack>, --exec=<git-receive-pack>
           Path to the git-receive-pack program on the remote end. Sometimes useful when pushing to a remote
           repository over ssh, and you do not have the program in a directory on the default $PATH.

       --force-with-lease, --no-force-with-lease, --force-with-lease=<refname>, --force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect>
           Usually, "git push" refuses to update a remote ref that is not an ancestor of the local ref used to
           overwrite it.

           This option overrides this restriction if the current value of the remote ref is the expected value. "git
           push" fails otherwise.

           Imagine that you have to rebase what you have already published. You will have to bypass the "must
           fast-forward" rule in order to replace the history you originally published with the rebased history. If
           somebody else built on top of your original history while you are rebasing, the tip of the branch at the
           remote may advance with their commit, and blindly pushing with --force will lose their work.

           This option allows you to say that you expect the history you are updating is what you rebased and want to
           replace. If the remote ref still points at the commit you specified, you can be sure that no other people
           did anything to the ref. It is like taking a "lease" on the ref without explicitly locking it, and the
           remote ref is updated only if the "lease" is still valid.

           --force-with-lease alone, without specifying the details, will protect all remote refs that are going to
           be updated by requiring their current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch we have for them.

           --force-with-lease=<refname>, without specifying the expected value, will protect the named ref (alone),
           if it is going to be updated, by requiring its current value to be the same as the remote-tracking branch
           we have for it.

           --force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect> will protect the named ref (alone), if it is going to be updated, by
           requiring its current value to be the same as the specified value <expect> (which is allowed to be
           different from the remote-tracking branch we have for the refname, or we do not even have to have such a
           remote-tracking branch when this form is used). If <expect> is the empty string, then the named ref must
           not already exist.

           Note that all forms other than --force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect> that specifies the expected current
           value of the ref explicitly are still experimental and their semantics may change as we gain experience
           with this feature.

           "--no-force-with-lease" will cancel all the previous --force-with-lease on the command line.

           A general note on safety: supplying this option without an expected value, i.e. as --force-with-lease or
           --force-with-lease=<refname> interacts very badly with anything that implicitly runs git fetch on the
           remote to be pushed to in the background, e.g.  git fetch origin on your repository in a cronjob.

           The protection it offers over --force is ensuring that subsequent changes your work wasn’t based on aren’t
           clobbered, but this is trivially defeated if some background process is updating refs in the background.
           We don’t have anything except the remote tracking info to go by as a heuristic for refs you’re expected to
           have seen & are willing to clobber.

           If your editor or some other system is running git fetch in the background for you a way to mitigate this
           is to simply set up another remote:

               git remote add origin-push $(git config remote.origin.url)
               git fetch origin-push

           Now when the background process runs git fetch origin the references on origin-push won’t be updated, and
           thus commands like:

               git push --force-with-lease origin-push

           Will fail unless you manually run git fetch origin-push. This method is of course entirely defeated by
           something that runs git fetch --all, in that case you’d need to either disable it or do something more
           tedious like:

               git fetch              # update 'master' from remote
               git tag base master    # mark our base point
               git rebase -i master   # rewrite some commits
               git push --force-with-lease=master:base master:master

           I.e. create a base tag for versions of the upstream code that you’ve seen and are willing to overwrite,
           then rewrite history, and finally force push changes to master if the remote version is still at base,
           regardless of what your local remotes/origin/master has been updated to in the background.

           Alternatively, specifying --force-if-includes as an ancillary option along with
           --force-with-lease[=<refname>] (i.e., without saying what exact commit the ref on the remote side must be
           pointing at, or which refs on the remote side are being protected) at the time of "push" will verify if
           updates from the remote-tracking refs that may have been implicitly updated in the background are
           integrated locally before allowing a forced update.

       -f, --force
           Usually, git push will refuse to update a branch that is not an ancestor of the commit being pushed.

           This flag disables that check, the other safety checks in PUSH RULES below, and the checks in
           --force-with-lease. It can cause the remote repository to lose commits; use it with care.

           Note that --force applies to all the refs that are pushed, hence using it with push.default set to
           matching or with multiple push destinations configured with remote.*.push may overwrite refs other than
           the current branch (including local refs that are strictly behind their remote counterpart). To force a
           push to only one branch, use a + in front of the refspec to push (e.g git push origin +master to force a
           push to the master branch). See the <refspec>... section above for details.

       --force-if-includes, --no-force-if-includes
           Force an update only if the tip of the remote-tracking ref has been integrated locally.

           This option enables a check that verifies if the tip of the remote-tracking ref is reachable from one of
           the "reflog" entries of the local branch based in it for a rewrite. The check ensures that any updates
           from the remote have been incorporated locally by rejecting the forced update if that is not the case.

           If the option is passed without specifying --force-with-lease, or specified along with
           --force-with-lease=<refname>:<expect>, it is a "no-op".

           Specifying --no-force-if-includes disables this behavior.

       --repo=<repository>
           This option is equivalent to the <repository> argument. If both are specified, the command-line argument
           takes precedence.

       -u, --set-upstream
           For every branch that is up to date or successfully pushed, add upstream (tracking) reference, used by
           argument-less git-pull(1) and other commands. For more information, see branch.<name>.merge in git-
           config(1).

       --thin, --no-thin
           These options are passed to git-send-pack(1). A thin transfer significantly reduces the amount of sent
           data when the sender and receiver share many of the same objects in common. The default is --thin.

       -q, --quiet
           Suppress all output, including the listing of updated refs, unless an error occurs. Progress is not
           reported to the standard error stream.

       -v, --verbose
           Run verbosely.

       --progress
           Progress status is reported on the standard error stream by default when it is attached to a terminal,
           unless -q is specified. This flag forces progress status even if the standard error stream is not directed
           to a terminal.

       --no-recurse-submodules, --recurse-submodules=check|on-demand|only|no
           May be used to make sure all submodule commits used by the revisions to be pushed are available on a
           remote-tracking branch. If check is used Git will verify that all submodule commits that changed in the
           revisions to be pushed are available on at least one remote of the submodule. If any commits are missing
           the push will be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If on-demand is used all submodules that changed
           in the revisions to be pushed will be pushed. If on-demand was not able to push all necessary revisions it
           will also be aborted and exit with non-zero status. If only is used all submodules will be pushed while
           the superproject is left unpushed. A value of no or using --no-recurse-submodules can be used to override
           the push.recurseSubmodules configuration variable when no submodule recursion is required.

           When using on-demand or only, if a submodule has a "push.recurseSubmodules={on-demand,only}" or
           "submodule.recurse" configuration, further recursion will occur. In this case, "only" is treated as
           "on-demand".

       --verify, --no-verify
           Toggle the pre-push hook (see githooks(5)). The default is --verify, giving the hook a chance to prevent
           the push. With --no-verify, the hook is bypassed completely.

       -4, --ipv4
           Use IPv4 addresses only, ignoring IPv6 addresses.

       -6, --ipv6
           Use IPv6 addresses only, ignoring IPv4 addresses.

GIT URLS
       In general, URLs contain information about the transport protocol, the address of the remote server, and the
       path to the repository. Depending on the transport protocol, some of this information may be absent.

       Git supports ssh, git, http, and https protocols (in addition, ftp and ftps can be used for fetching, but this
       is inefficient and deprecated; do not use them).

       The native transport (i.e. git:// URL) does no authentication and should be used with caution on unsecured
       networks.

       The following syntaxes may be used with them:

       •   ssh://[<user>@]<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

       •   git://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

       •   http[s]://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

       •   ftp[s]://<host>[:<port>]/<path-to-git-repo>

       An alternative scp-like syntax may also be used with the ssh protocol:

       •   [<user>@]<host>:/<path-to-git-repo>

       This syntax is only recognized if there are no slashes before the first colon. This helps differentiate a
       local path that contains a colon. For example the local path foo:bar could be specified as an absolute path or
       ./foo:bar to avoid being misinterpreted as an ssh url.

       The ssh and git protocols additionally support ~<username> expansion:

       •   ssh://[<user>@]<host>[:<port>]/~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

       •   git://<host>[:<port>]/~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

       •   [<user>@]<host>:~<user>/<path-to-git-repo>

       For local repositories, also supported by Git natively, the following syntaxes may be used:

       •   /path/to/repo.git/

       •   file:///path/to/repo.git/

       These two syntaxes are mostly equivalent, except when cloning, when the former implies --local option. See
       git-clone(1) for details.

       git clone, git fetch and git pull, but not git push, will also accept a suitable bundle file. See git-
       bundle(1).

       When Git doesn’t know how to handle a certain transport protocol, it attempts to use the remote-<transport>
       remote helper, if one exists. To explicitly request a remote helper, the following syntax may be used:

       •   <transport>::<address>

       where <address> may be a path, a server and path, or an arbitrary URL-like string recognized by the specific
       remote helper being invoked. See gitremote-helpers(7) for details.

       If there are a large number of similarly-named remote repositories and you want to use a different format for
       them (such that the URLs you use will be rewritten into URLs that work), you can create a configuration
       section of the form:

                   [url "<actual-url-base>"]
                           insteadOf = <other-url-base>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "git://git.host.xz/"]
                           insteadOf = host.xz:/path/to/
                           insteadOf = work:

       a URL like "work:repo.git" or like "host.xz:/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten in any context that takes a
       URL to be "git://git.host.xz/repo.git".

       If you want to rewrite URLs for push only, you can create a configuration section of the form:

                   [url "<actual-url-base>"]
                           pushInsteadOf = <other-url-base>

       For example, with this:

                   [url "ssh://example.org/"]
                           pushInsteadOf = git://example.org/

       a URL like "git://example.org/path/to/repo.git" will be rewritten to "ssh://example.org/path/to/repo.git" for
       pushes, but pulls will still use the original URL.

REMOTES
       The name of one of the following can be used instead of a URL as <repository> argument:

       •   a remote in the Git configuration file: $GIT_DIR/config,

       •   a file in the $GIT_DIR/remotes directory, or

       •   a file in the $GIT_DIR/branches directory.

       All of these also allow you to omit the refspec from the command line because they each contain a refspec
       which git will use by default.

   Named remote in configuration file
       You can choose to provide the name of a remote which you had previously configured using git-remote(1), git-
       config(1) or even by a manual edit to the $GIT_DIR/config file. The URL of this remote will be used to access
       the repository. The refspec of this remote will be used by default when you do not provide a refspec on the
       command line. The entry in the config file would appear like this:

                   [remote "<name>"]
                           url = <URL>
                           pushurl = <pushurl>
                           push = <refspec>
                           fetch = <refspec>

       The <pushurl> is used for pushes only. It is optional and defaults to <URL>. Pushing to a remote affects all
       defined pushurls or all defined urls if no pushurls are defined. Fetch, however, will only fetch from the
       first defined url if multiple urls are defined.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/remotes
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/remotes. The URL in this file will be used to access
       the repository. The refspec in this file will be used as default when you do not provide a refspec on the
       command line. This file should have the following format:

                   URL: one of the above URL formats
                   Push: <refspec>
                   Pull: <refspec>

       Push: lines are used by git push and Pull: lines are used by git pull and git fetch. Multiple Push: and Pull:
       lines may be specified for additional branch mappings.

   Named file in $GIT_DIR/branches
       You can choose to provide the name of a file in $GIT_DIR/branches. The URL in this file will be used to access
       the repository. This file should have the following format:

                   <URL>#<head>

       <URL> is required; #<head> is optional.

       Depending on the operation, git will use one of the following refspecs, if you don’t provide one on the
       command line. <branch> is the name of this file in $GIT_DIR/branches and <head> defaults to master.

       git fetch uses:

                   refs/heads/<head>:refs/heads/<branch>

       git push uses:

                   HEAD:refs/heads/<head>

UPSTREAM BRANCHES
       Branches in Git can optionally have an upstream remote branch. Git defaults to using the upstream branch for
       remote operations, for example:

       •   It’s the default for git pull or git fetch with no arguments.

       •   It’s the default for git push with no arguments, with some exceptions. For example, you can use the
           branch.<name>.pushRemote option to push to a different remote than you pull from, and by default with
           push.default=simple the upstream branch you configure must have the same name.

       •   Various commands, including git checkout and git status, will show you how many commits have been added to
           your current branch and the upstream since you forked from it, for example "Your branch and origin/main
           have diverged, and have 2 and 3 different commits each respectively".

       The upstream is stored in .git/config, in the "remote" and "merge" fields. For example, if main's upstream is
       origin/main:

           [branch "main"]
              remote = origin
              merge = refs/heads/main

       You can set an upstream branch explicitly with git push --set-upstream <remote> <branch> but Git will often
       automatically set the upstream for you, for example:

       •   When you clone a repository, Git will automatically set the upstream for the default branch.

       •   If you have the push.autoSetupRemote configuration option set, git push will automatically set the
           upstream the first time you push a branch.

       •   Checking out a remote-tracking branch with git checkout <branch> will automatically create a local branch
           with that name and set the upstream to the remote branch.

           Note

           Upstream branches are sometimes referred to as "tracking information", as in "set the branch’s tracking
           information".

OUTPUT
       The output of "git push" depends on the transport method used; this section describes the output when pushing
       over the Git protocol (either locally or via ssh).

       The status of the push is output in tabular form, with each line representing the status of a single ref. Each
       line is of the form:

            <flag> <summary> <from> -> <to> (<reason>)

       If --porcelain is used, then each line of the output is of the form:

            <flag> \t <from>:<to> \t <summary> (<reason>)

       The status of up-to-date refs is shown only if --porcelain or --verbose option is used.

       flag
           A single character indicating the status of the ref:

           (space)
               for a successfully pushed fast-forward;

           +
               for a successful forced update;

           -
               for a successfully deleted ref;

           *
               for a successfully pushed new ref;

           !
               for a ref that was rejected or failed to push; and

           =
               for a ref that was up to date and did not need pushing.

       summary
           For a successfully pushed ref, the summary shows the old and new values of the ref in a form suitable for
           using as an argument to git log (this is <old>..<new> in most cases, and <old>...<new> for forced
           non-fast-forward updates).

           For a failed update, more details are given:

           rejected
               Git did not try to send the ref at all, typically because it is not a fast-forward and you did not
               force the update.

           remote rejected
               The remote end refused the update. Usually caused by a hook on the remote side, or because the remote
               repository has one of the following safety options in effect: receive.denyCurrentBranch (for pushes to
               the checked out branch), receive.denyNonFastForwards (for forced non-fast-forward updates),
               receive.denyDeletes or receive.denyDeleteCurrent. See git-config(1).

           remote failure
               The remote end did not report the successful update of the ref, perhaps because of a temporary error
               on the remote side, a break in the network connection, or other transient error.

       from
           The name of the local ref being pushed, minus its refs/<type>/ prefix. In the case of deletion, the name
           of the local ref is omitted.

       to
           The name of the remote ref being updated, minus its refs/<type>/ prefix.

       reason
           A human-readable explanation. In the case of successfully pushed refs, no explanation is needed. For a
           failed ref, the reason for failure is described.

PUSH RULES
       As a safety feature, the git push command only allows certain kinds of updates to prevent you from
       accidentally losing data on the remote.

       Because branches and tags are intended to be used differently, the safety rules for pushing to a branch are
       different from the rules for pushing to a tag. In the following rules "update" means any modifications except
       deletions and creations. Deletions and creations are always allowed, except when forbidden by configuration or
       hooks.

        1. If the push destination is a branch (refs/heads/*): only fast-forward updates are allowed, which means the
           destination must be an ancestor of the source commit. The source must be a commit.

        2. If the push destination is a tag (refs/tags/*): all updates will be rejected. The source can be any
           object.

        3. If the push destination is not a branch or tag:

           •   If the source is a tree or blob object, any updates will be rejected

           •   If the source is a tag or commit object, any fast-forward update is allowed, even in cases where
               what’s being fast-forwarded is not a commit, but a tag object which happens to point to a new commit
               which is a fast-forward of the commit the last tag (or commit) it’s replacing. Replacing a tag with an
               entirely different tag is also allowed, if it points to the same commit, as well as pushing a peeled
               tag, i.e. pushing the commit that existing tag object points to, or a new tag object which an existing
               commit points to.

       You can override these rules by passing --force or by adding the optional leading + to a refspec. The only
       exceptions are that no amount of forcing will make a branch accept a non-commit object, and forcing won’t make
       the remote repository accept a push that it’s configured to deny.

       Hooks and configuration can also override or amend these rules, see e.g. receive.denyNonFastForwards and
       receive.denyDeletes in git-config(1) and pre-receive and update in githooks(5).

NOTE ABOUT FAST-FORWARDS
       When an update changes a branch (or more in general, a ref) that used to point at commit A to point at another
       commit B, it is called a fast-forward update if and only if B is a descendant of A.

       In a fast-forward update from A to B, the set of commits that the original commit A built on top of is a
       subset of the commits the new commit B builds on top of. Hence, it does not lose any history.

       In contrast, a non-fast-forward update will lose history. For example, suppose you and somebody else started
       at the same commit X, and you built a history leading to commit B while the other person built a history
       leading to commit A. The history looks like this:

                 B
                /
            ---X---A

       Further suppose that the other person already pushed changes leading to A back to the original repository from
       which you two obtained the original commit X.

       The push done by the other person updated the branch that used to point at commit X to point at commit A. It
       is a fast-forward.

       But if you try to push, you will attempt to update the branch (that now points at A) with commit B. This does
       not fast-forward. If you did so, the changes introduced by commit A will be lost, because everybody will now
       start building on top of B.

       The command by default does not allow an update that is not a fast-forward to prevent such loss of history.

       If you do not want to lose your work (history from X to B) or the work by the other person (history from X to
       A), you would need to first fetch the history from the repository, create a history that contains changes done
       by both parties, and push the result back.

       You can perform "git pull", resolve potential conflicts, and "git push" the result. A "git pull" will create a
       merge commit C between commits A and B.

                 B---C
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Updating A with the resulting merge commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.

       Alternatively, you can rebase your change between X and B on top of A, with "git pull --rebase", and push the
       result back. The rebase will create a new commit D that builds the change between X and B on top of A.

                 B   D
                /   /
            ---X---A

       Again, updating A with this commit will fast-forward and your push will be accepted.

       There is another common situation where you may encounter non-fast-forward rejection when you try to push, and
       it is possible even when you are pushing into a repository nobody else pushes into. After you push commit A
       yourself (in the first picture in this section), replace it with "git commit --amend" to produce commit B, and
       you try to push it out, because forgot that you have pushed A out already. In such a case, and only if you are
       certain that nobody in the meantime fetched your earlier commit A (and started building on top of it), you can
       run "git push --force" to overwrite it. In other words, "git push --force" is a method reserved for a case
       where you do mean to lose history.

EXAMPLES
       git push
           Works like git push <remote>, where <remote> is the current branch’s remote (or origin, if no remote is
           configured for the current branch).

       git push origin
           Without additional configuration, pushes the current branch to the configured upstream
           (branch.<name>.merge configuration variable) if it has the same name as the current branch, and errors out
           without pushing otherwise.

           The default behavior of this command when no <refspec> is given can be configured by setting the push
           option of the remote, or the push.default configuration variable.

           For example, to default to pushing only the current branch to origin use git config remote.origin.push
           HEAD. Any valid <refspec> (like the ones in the examples below) can be configured as the default for git
           push origin.

       git push origin :
           Push "matching" branches to origin. See <refspec> in the OPTIONS section above for a description of
           "matching" branches.

       git push origin master
           Find a ref that matches master in the source repository (most likely, it would find refs/heads/master),
           and update the same ref (e.g.  refs/heads/master) in origin repository with it. If master did not exist
           remotely, it would be created.

       git push origin HEAD
           A handy way to push the current branch to the same name on the remote.

       git push mothership master:satellite/master dev:satellite/dev
           Use the source ref that matches master (e.g.  refs/heads/master) to update the ref that matches
           satellite/master (most probably refs/remotes/satellite/master) in the mothership repository; do the same
           for dev and satellite/dev.

           See the section describing <refspec>... above for a discussion of the matching semantics.

           This is to emulate git fetch run on the mothership using git push that is run in the opposite direction in
           order to integrate the work done on satellite, and is often necessary when you can only make connection in
           one way (i.e. satellite can ssh into mothership but mothership cannot initiate connection to satellite
           because the latter is behind a firewall or does not run sshd).

           After running this git push on the satellite machine, you would ssh into the mothership and run git merge
           there to complete the emulation of git pull that were run on mothership to pull changes made on satellite.

       git push origin HEAD:master
           Push the current branch to the remote ref matching master in the origin repository. This form is
           convenient to push the current branch without thinking about its local name.

       git push origin master:refs/heads/experimental
           Create the branch experimental in the origin repository by copying the current master branch. This form is
           only needed to create a new branch or tag in the remote repository when the local name and the remote name
           are different; otherwise, the ref name on its own will work.

       git push origin :experimental
           Find a ref that matches experimental in the origin repository (e.g.  refs/heads/experimental), and delete
           it.

       git push origin +dev:master
           Update the origin repository’s master branch with the dev branch, allowing non-fast-forward updates.  This
           can leave unreferenced commits dangling in the origin repository.  Consider the following situation, where
           a fast-forward is not possible:

                           o---o---o---A---B  origin/master
                                    \
                                     X---Y---Z  dev

           The above command would change the origin repository to

                                     A---B  (unnamed branch)
                                    /
                           o---o---o---X---Y---Z  master

           Commits A and B would no longer belong to a branch with a symbolic name, and so would be unreachable. As
           such, these commits would be removed by a git gc command on the origin repository.

SECURITY
       The fetch and push protocols are not designed to prevent one side from stealing data from the other repository
       that was not intended to be shared. If you have private data that you need to protect from a malicious peer,
       your best option is to store it in another repository. This applies to both clients and servers. In
       particular, namespaces on a server are not effective for read access control; you should only grant read
       access to a namespace to clients that you would trust with read access to the entire repository.

       The known attack vectors are as follows:

        1. The victim sends "have" lines advertising the IDs of objects it has that are not explicitly intended to be
           shared but can be used to optimize the transfer if the peer also has them. The attacker chooses an object
           ID X to steal and sends a ref to X, but isn’t required to send the content of X because the victim already
           has it. Now the victim believes that the attacker has X, and it sends the content of X back to the
           attacker later. (This attack is most straightforward for a client to perform on a server, by creating a
           ref to X in the namespace the client has access to and then fetching it. The most likely way for a server
           to perform it on a client is to "merge" X into a public branch and hope that the user does additional work
           on this branch and pushes it back to the server without noticing the merge.)

        2. As in #1, the attacker chooses an object ID X to steal. The victim sends an object Y that the attacker
           already has, and the attacker falsely claims to have X and not Y, so the victim sends Y as a delta against
           X. The delta reveals regions of X that are similar to Y to the attacker.

CONFIGURATION
       Everything below this line in this section is selectively included from the git-config(1) documentation. The
       content is the same as what’s found there:

       push.autoSetupRemote
           If set to "true" assume --set-upstream on default push when no upstream tracking exists for the current
           branch; this option takes effect with push.default options simple, upstream, and current. It is useful if
           by default you want new branches to be pushed to the default remote (like the behavior of
           push.default=current) and you also want the upstream tracking to be set. Workflows most likely to benefit
           from this option are simple central workflows where all branches are expected to have the same name on the
           remote.

       push.default
           Defines the action git push should take if no refspec is given (whether from the command-line, config, or
           elsewhere). Different values are well-suited for specific workflows; for instance, in a purely central
           workflow (i.e. the fetch source is equal to the push destination), upstream is probably what you want.
           Possible values are:

           •   nothing - do not push anything (error out) unless a refspec is given. This is primarily meant for
               people who want to avoid mistakes by always being explicit.

           •   current - push the current branch to update a branch with the same name on the receiving end. Works in
               both central and non-central workflows.

           •   upstream - push the current branch back to the branch whose changes are usually integrated into the
               current branch (which is called @{upstream}). This mode only makes sense if you are pushing to the
               same repository you would normally pull from (i.e. central workflow).

           •   tracking - This is a deprecated synonym for upstream.

           •   simple - push the current branch with the same name on the remote.

               If you are working on a centralized workflow (pushing to the same repository you pull from, which is
               typically origin), then you need to configure an upstream branch with the same name.

               This mode is the default since Git 2.0, and is the safest option suited for beginners.

           •   matching - push all branches having the same name on both ends. This makes the repository you are
               pushing to remember the set of branches that will be pushed out (e.g. if you always push maint and
               master there and no other branches, the repository you push to will have these two branches, and your
               local maint and master will be pushed there).

               To use this mode effectively, you have to make sure all the branches you would push out are ready to
               be pushed out before running git push, as the whole point of this mode is to allow you to push all of
               the branches in one go. If you usually finish work on only one branch and push out the result, while
               other branches are unfinished, this mode is not for you. Also this mode is not suitable for pushing
               into a shared central repository, as other people may add new branches there, or update the tip of
               existing branches outside your control.

               This used to be the default, but not since Git 2.0 (simple is the new default).

       push.followTags
           If set to true, enable --follow-tags option by default. You may override this configuration at time of
           push by specifying --no-follow-tags.

       push.gpgSign
           May be set to a boolean value, or the string if-asked. A true value causes all pushes to be GPG signed, as
           if --signed is passed to git-push(1). The string if-asked causes pushes to be signed if the server
           supports it, as if --signed=if-asked is passed to git push. A false value may override a value from a
           lower-priority config file. An explicit command-line flag always overrides this config option.

       push.pushOption
           When no --push-option=<option> argument is given from the command line, git push behaves as if each
           <value> of this variable is given as --push-option=<value>.

           This is a multi-valued variable, and an empty value can be used in a higher priority configuration file
           (e.g.  .git/config in a repository) to clear the values inherited from a lower priority configuration
           files (e.g.  $HOME/.gitconfig).

               Example:

               /etc/gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = a
                 push.pushoption = b

               ~/.gitconfig
                 push.pushoption = c

               repo/.git/config
                 push.pushoption =
                 push.pushoption = b

               This will result in only b (a and c are cleared).

       push.recurseSubmodules
           May be "check", "on-demand", "only", or "no", with the same behavior as that of "push
           --recurse-submodules". If not set, no is used by default, unless submodule.recurse is set (in which case a
           true value means on-demand).

       push.useForceIfIncludes
           If set to "true", it is equivalent to specifying --force-if-includes as an option to git-push(1) in the
           command line. Adding --no-force-if-includes at the time of push overrides this configuration setting.

       push.negotiate
           If set to "true", attempt to reduce the size of the packfile sent by rounds of negotiation in which the
           client and the server attempt to find commits in common. If "false", Git will rely solely on the server’s
           ref advertisement to find commits in common.

       push.useBitmaps
           If set to "false", disable use of bitmaps for "git push" even if pack.useBitmaps is "true", without
           preventing other git operations from using bitmaps. Default is true.
